# MazePathfinderBot
Maze-solving application in Java with Swing, showcasing DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms with interactive visualizations.

## Overview
Done with a group of four members, our goal was to implement and simulate different pathfinding algorithms. We used Java for the backend logic and Java Swing for the UI and animation. Users can generate mazes of custom sizes and watch how each algorithm explores the grid and finds the optimal path.

## Features
- Implements DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A*
- Interactive visualization
- Custom grid sizes
- Step-by-step animation of search algorithm
- Counter for number of visits and actual steps

## Tech Stack
- Frontend/UI: Java Swing
- Backend/Logic: Java

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/byanka8/MazePathfinderBot
cd MazePathfinderBot
```

## Usage
- Run `MG.java` in vscode
- Chooze maze size (8 - 64)
- Choose to generate maze or empty maze by clicking button
- Choose specific algorithm by clicking button
- Animation starts
- You can choose another algorithm on the same maze. You can also modify the current maze by clicking a specific cell.
